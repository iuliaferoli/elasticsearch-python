# Episode 1 - Overview of Elasticsearch
## Basics of using the REST APIs

See an overview of all [Elasticsearch APIs on the docs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/rest-apis.html).

You can use the [Dev Console](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/console-kibana.html) in the Elastic UI to quickly test these queries, or send them to your Elasticsearch engine via a proxy tool for HTTPS requests such as Postman. 

The result of your requests will be JSONs including metadata such as how long the query took, along with the hits (results that were relevant to the query if applicable).

## Create and populate an Index

Your documents will be added and store into an index. [See Index API.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices.html)

Let's create a new one for our weather information:

```
PUT weather-data 
```

You can add documents to the index you've created, by adding the document body (in a JSON format) after your HTTP request. See [Document APIs.](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs.html)

(You can aslso use the PUT API when you don't pecific the id of the document manually)

```
POST weather-data/_doc/0
{
  "date": "22-03-2024",
  "temperature": 9,
  "location": { 
    "type": "Point",
    "coordinates": [52.36, 4.90]
  },
  "city": "Amsterdam",
  "description": "overcast and a little rainy, just like always"
}
```

Later on, you can [make changes](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-update.html) to exisitng documents by creating scripts in the Elasticsearch painless language. (More on that later, this is just a sneak peek at more complex syntaxes)


```
POST weather-data/_update/0
{
  "script": {
    "source": "ctx._source.description = 'oh wow the Sun just came out!'",
    "lang": "painless"
  }
}
```


Or add multiple documents at once with ```bulk```.

```
POST _bulk
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "23-03-2024", "description": "today it was actually sunny!"}
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "20-03-2024", "description": "lots of rain. what a surprise"}
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "19-03-2024", "description": "cloudy. dark. sad."}
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "18-03-2024", "description": "oh look at that, rainy again."}
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "17-03-2024", "description": "just bleh."}
{"index": {"_index": "weather-data"}}
{"date": "17-03-2024", "description": "we got sun for about 2 minutes!"}
```

## Search!

We can build queries to search through our data with the same JSON format and the [Search APIs](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search.html). You need to specify the type of query and the request itself. Read more about [the query language](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html) Elasticsearch uses. 

```
GET weather-data/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "description" : "rainy"
    }
  }
}
```

You can build up more complex queries by layering multple terms:

```
GET weather-data/_search
{
  "query": {
    "bool" : {
      "must" : {
        "match" : { "description" : "rainy" }
      },
      "filter": {
        "range": {
          "date" : { "gte": "2024" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Deleting a document or index

Finally, you can delete documents from your index based on their ID:


```
DELETE weather-data/_doc/e275ZY4BwilPZPvyIEDM
```

Or delete the entire index:


```
DELETE weather-data
```
